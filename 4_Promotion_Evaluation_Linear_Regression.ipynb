We will separate the data by customer segment and run each segment separately to understand the impact of each promotion on the individual segment. This one should be the most interesting as it will support future targeting efforts for the marketing department. "

We will give both metrics equal weight, meaning that a model performs better if it has both a higher R-squared adjusted and a lower MAPE.

    "### R-squared Adjusted and MAPE\n",
    "Unfortunately, we cannot directly compare the R-squared adjusted and MAPE values between the models since the models are not based on the same underlying data (generally speaking it is of course the same data, but due slicing of the data for the segment models, it is not comparable). Again, the finer points of linear regression are beyond the scope of this project and course and we will not dive further into detail here. We will simply make a generalization as follows: if the R-squared adjusted and MAPE are *significantly* larger or smaller than the baseline model, then we should at least be aware of it. We'll define signficant as a 20% difference - so an R-squared 20% different than .54 would be less than .43 or greater than .65 and a 20% difference on the MAPE would be less than 173% or greater than 260%. Only 1 of our models has a MAPE worse than 260% but it's R-squared is still .45. Only 1 model has an R-squared less than .43 but it's MAPE is still 239%. Therefore, for our analysis we will state that none of our individual models were considerably less accurate than the baseline. This means we can comfortably analyze the individual coefficients and base our conclusions on the coefficients of the promotions in the individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NaN coefficients\n",
    "A NaN coefficient in our matrix implies than the promotion was considered to be insigificant. Or, more formally, we could not reject the null hypothesis that the given promotion had an impact on the y-variable (total amount purchased). For the Starbucks marketing department, this would imply that their promotion was a waste of time, effort, and money and should not be continued. If we focus only on the baseline, we see that promotion 7 has the only NaN, which would suggest they should cancel promotion 7 and keep the others (the others all had positive coefficients after all). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, looking at the individual models provides much more interesting coefficients. We very quickly find that many segments are indifferent to many promotions. Reading the matrix column-wise reveals that every promotion is ineffective on at least 1 customer segment. We also see that promotion 7 which was ineffective when measurd on the entire population is now effective for 3 customer segments (with fairly large coefficients). Only 1 segment has no Nans - segment 5 - which means they are responsive to all promotions. Many segments have many NaNs, with the most NaNs (row-wise) appearing in segment 8, for which only 2 promotions have impacts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnitude of coefficients\n",
    "The larger the absolute value of the coefficient, the larger the impact of the promotion is on the total amount purchased by the consumer. Focusing on the larger coefficients is the best strategy for increasing total amount purchased by consumers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The closer the coefficient is to 0, the less the overall impact. For those with a smaller magnitude, the marketing department may wish to evaluate the overall cost of the promotion (time, effort, and money) and may determine that those with the smallest coefficients are not worth the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting observation is the difference in magnitude of coefficients for the same promotion across different models. For example, promotion 0 has a very small coefficient - 1.4 - in our baseline model. However, in customer segment 1 the coefficient for the same promotion is very high at 42.6. While our baseline model may suggest that the promotion is barely worth the time and effort, our segmentation has indicated that this promotion is very valuable on a customer segment 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative coefficients\n",
    "These are especially interesting for the marketing department because they imply that the promotion actually *decreased* the total amount purchased by the consumer. This indicates that the promotion should immediately be canceled for a given customer segment! We actually find 5 negative coefficients in our data - fortunately their magnitudes are small - but they still should be immediately reconsidered."

    "# Final Recommendation\n",
    "The final recommendation will be based on the most impactful findings of our model. While a deeper analysis and fine tuning of our model could produce more insights, the main findings of our current model can already provide a significant improvement in the marketing strategy.
